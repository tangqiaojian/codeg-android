/**
 * Bounded LRU cache for parsed Markdown blocks, used ONLY by the persisted node-build
 * path. A long assistant message is split into per-block timeline nodes at build time,
 * and the transcript re-builds whenever `ui.turns` changes (send / completion /
 * reattach) — without a cache that means re-scanning every persisted message's markdown
 * on the main thread each time. Keyed by the message text (stable → String.hashCode is
 * JVM-cached after the first lookup), so unchanged messages are parsed once.
 *
 * The growing *live* text is deliberately NOT cached here (it flows through
 * [LiveBlockParser] instead); a per-flush key would churn and evict useful persisted
 * entries. Access is single-threaded in practice (the main-thread node build), guarded
 * with `@Synchronized` as cheap insurance.
